## 🎮 Usage Guide

### Creating Your First Agent

1. Navigate to the **Agents** tab in the dashboard
2. Click **"Spawn New Agent"**
3. Define the agent's name and specialization role
4. The agent will automatically initialize and begin learning

### Setting Global Directives

Use the **Global Directive** input to influence the entire agent collective:
- "Focus on e-commerce platform development"
- "Research latest AI frameworks for recommendation systems"
- "Optimize for mobile-first user experience"

### Monitoring Collaboration

The **Hive Mind** tab provides real-time visibility into:
- Inter-agent communication streams
- Collaborative decision-making processes
- Knowledge sharing and synthesis
- Collective intelligence metrics

### Project Management

Agents automatically organize work into projects with:
- Progress tracking and milestone management
- Agent assignment and role distribution
- Real-time status updates and notifications
- Automated quality assurance and testing

## 🔧 Configuration

### Agent Customization

Agents can be configured with specific:
- **Capabilities**: Technical skills and knowledge domains
- **Personality Traits**: Communication style and decision-making patterns
- **Learning Parameters**: Adaptation speed and memory retention
- **Collaboration Preferences**: Interaction patterns with other agents

### Platform Settings
